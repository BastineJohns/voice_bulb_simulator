## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Voice recognition using Python's `speech_recognition` library  
- ✅ Simulates a bulb turning ON/OFF based on recognized commands  
- ✅ Modular code structure (easy to extend with real hardware later)  
- ✅ Compatible with Windows (Python 3.9+ recommended)  
- ✅ Works offline after initial setup
